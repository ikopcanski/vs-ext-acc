# vs-ext-ccc
Visual Studio extension for generating code contracts (from Microsoft  RiSE project) for your interfaces.
They work as validation for input parameters and output values, triggered optionally during debugging. 
Relieves you from having the validation code clutter in begging or end of methods and properties,
but you can still have that exception you want thrown when unexpected value enters or leaves method/property.
This VS extension generates the class that appears "hidden under" your interface in Solution Explorer.
