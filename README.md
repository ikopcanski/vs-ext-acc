Handy extension for easy and unified usage of Code Contracts (from Microsoft RiSE project): New context menu in Solution Explorer creates abstract class marked with [CodeContractFor] attribute so you can continue writing your Contract.* statement right away. Further on, you can generate validation class based on Proxy design pattern and statements you wrote. Any DI container can then be configured to wrap instances with generated proxy class.
